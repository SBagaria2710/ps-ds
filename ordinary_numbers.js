/*
Let's call a positive integer 𝑛 ordinary if in the decimal notation all its digits are the same. For example, 1, 2 and 99 are ordinary numbers, but 719 and 2021 are not ordinary numbers.

For a given number 𝑛, find the number of ordinary numbers among the numbers from 1 to 𝑛.

Input
The first line contains one integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104). Then 𝑡 test cases follow.

Each test case is characterized by one integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤109).

Output
For each test case output the number of ordinary numbers among numbers from 1 to 𝑛.
